# hello-world
My first repository for learning purposes
My name is Alessandro and I'm currently practising to master GitHub features. It all started with the course "Data Scientist Toolbox" from John Hopkins University on Coursera. Hope you enjoy my (future) work :)

This is a new change I made a year after creating this account. Git Bash is awesome!
